    history: 'The Somnath Temple, known as the "Eternal Shrine", is one of the twelve sacred Jyotirlinga shrines of Lord Shiva.

The temple has faced destruction multiple times - by Mahmud of Ghazni (1026 CE), Alauddin Khilji (1299 CE), and Ahmad Shah I of Gujarat (1395 CE). Each time, it was rebuilt by devoted kings and communities. The current magnificent structure was reconstructed under the vision of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and was consecrated by Dr. Rajendra Prasad, the first President of India, on May 11, 1951. The temple stands as a symbol of resilience and eternal faith.',

The temple represents the eternal spirit of Sanatan Dharma and the undying faith of devotees. It is believed that Lord Krishna left his mortal body near Somnath, making it a sacred site for both Shaivites and Vaishnavites. The temple is also known as "Deo Pattan" and "Prabhas Pattan".',

The temple\'s origins trace back thousands of years, mentioned in ancient Puranas and Tantric texts. The current structure has been renovated multiple times, with major renovations in the 20th century. The temple has been a center of Shakti worship and attracts millions of devotees, especially during Navratri when grand celebrations are held for nine days.',

It is believed that the Divine Mother fulfills all wishes of her devotees. The temple is also famous for its Navratri celebrations, which attract devotees from across India and abroad. The phrase "Ambaji no Mandvo" (invitation to Ambaji) is commonly used in Gujarati wedding invitations, showing the temple\'s cultural significance.',

The entrance is adorned with silver-plated doors and the entire complex is built using white marble, giving it a divine and serene appearance.',
